		<strong><h2>CGI-Scripts</h2></strong>
		
		<h4>A word of caution</h4>
		<p>I would like to remind you that it is very good practice to learn how to use a Virtual Machine in order to
			learn in a sandbox environment. Many of the things that you will do when playing around with Apache will
			require elevated priviledges, so be careful.</p>
		
		<h4>Installing Apache</h4>
		
		<p>Students using <strong>Windows</strong> may download Apache from
		<a href="https://www.apachelounge.com/download/">here.</a>
		<strong>macOS</strong> ships with Apache so you probably don't need to do something for now.</p>

		
		<h4>Configuring Apache</h4>
	<p>We will edit some configuration files to have Apache serve content from the directory that you want. 
		First you need to locate <code>httpd.conf</code> and open it with your favorite text editor. In order to edit
		<code>httpd.conf</code> you need elevated priviledges so the easiest way it would be to open it using 
		<code>sudo</code> on Mac:
		<pre class="tty">$ <span class="ttytype">sudo vim httpd.conf</span></pre>
		You can replace <code>vim</code> with the command to open your text editor. You need to be in the proper
		directory, probably that would be <code>/etc/apache2</code>.</p>
		
		<p>On Windows, you need to <code>Run as Administrator</code> in order to be able to make changes to
			<code>sudo</code>. The file will be in the directory that you unpacked when you downloaded Apache.</p>
		
		<p>In <code>httpd.conf</code> you will find <emph>a lot</emph> of lines. Some that are of interest to us are
		the following:</p>
		
		<p>Find this line:
			
		<pre class="tty"><code class="bash">LoadModule cgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgi.so</code></pre>
		and uncomment it.</p>
		<p>Apache needs to know that a particular directory is set aside for CGI programs. 
		Apache will assume that every file in this directory 
		is a CGI program, and will attempt to execute it, 
			when that particular resource is requested by a client. This is done by 
			<code>ScriptAlias</code>. For example by default in Mac there will be a line
			<pre class="tty"><code class="bash">ScriptAliasMatch ^/cgi-bin/((?!(?i:webobjects)).*$) "/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/$1"</code></pre>
			which means that there is a preset ScriptAlias for the <code>/cgi-bin/</code> to 
			<code>/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/</code>. You can change this to whatever folder you want
			to use.</p>
	<p>Next we want to find the following:
<pre class="tty"><code class="bash"> &lt;Directory "/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables"&gt;
    AllowOverride None
    Allow from all
    Options ExecCGI
    Require all granted
    AddHandler cgi-script .py
&lt;/Directory&gt; </code></pre>
		This will not be exactly as you see it as I have added the lines that you need to type in.</p>
		
		
<p>Now we will create a simple HTML file, named <code>input_name.html</code> that will prompt the user to write 
	something in a box and will point to a
	<code>form.py</code> script that lives in the webserver and it will do something with the information it gets from
	<code>input_name.html</code>:
	<pre class="tty"><code class="html">&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Demo HTML file&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form name="pyform" method="POST" action="http://localhost/cgi-bin/form.py"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="fname" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;<code></pre></p>
	
<p>Additionally, we'll create a <code>form.py</code> script to print what the user wrote in the box
of <code>input_name.html</code>:
<pre class="tty"><code class="python">#!/usr/local/bin/python3
print("Content-Type: text/html")    
print()

import cgi,cgitb
cgitb.enable() #for debugging
form = cgi.FieldStorage()
name = form.getvalue('fname')
print("Name of the user is:",name)</code></pre>
