		<strong><h2>October 11 - Intro to Python</h2></strong>
		
		<h4>Starting</h4>
		<p>There is a number of ways that we can do this. The simplest one is having the python intepreter 
			coupled with a text editor. This can be a bit tricky for people using the Windows 
			operating system so we will use a 
			neat IDE called PyCharm. 
		
		<h4>Downloading and installing Python 3 on your computer</h4>
		<p>If you are using a Mac simply head over to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python website </a> and
			download the most recent package. Then double-click on the downloaded file to run the Python 3 installer.
		<p>If you are using Windows, download the suitable installer from the
			<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python website </a>. Double-click on the installer and
			on the first screen, check the <code>Add Python 3.x to PATH</code> option and install. This will let you
			use python in your terminal. Then click the <code>Disable path length limit</code> 
			option to will allow Python to use long path names. If after the installation you type python in the
		 terminal and still get an error then you will have to configure this manually. There is a good answer at 
			<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path">Superuser</a>
				 (be careful no to copy-paste mindlessly what you find on the Internet) and 
			<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/using/windows.html#finding-the-python-executable">docs</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>PyCharm and other editors</h4>
		<p>There is a number of good editors that you can use if you don't want to use PyCharm:
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
			</ul>
		As far as PyCharm goes, you can download the free Community version from the 
		<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">JetBrains website</a>. It is fine if you want to use
		any other IDE but this is the one that we'll be mainly using for demonstrating stuff.</p>
		
		<p>You can find help installing PyCharm <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/install-and-set-up-pycharm.html">
			here</a>.
		<p>You may use Jupyter notebooks if you are comfortable with it but it will probably be a bit of a hassle
			later on. I will try and find some good resources for using Jupyter with SQL and I will post them
			here.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Important:</strong> Be sure that you have configured python properly and that you are able to run
			just the simplest scripts before the next tutorial. We can't afford to lose time trying to set up
			machines again.
