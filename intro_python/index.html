		<strong><h2>October 11 - Intro to Python</h2></strong>
		
		<h4>Starting</h4>
		<p>There is a number of ways that we can do this. The simplest one is having the python intepreter 
			coupled with a text editor. This can be a bit tricky for people using the Windows 
			operating system so we will use a 
			very simple IDE called PyCharm. 
		
		<h4>Downloading and installing Python 3 on your computer</h4>
		<p>If you are using a Mac simply head over to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python website </a> and
			download the most recent package. Then double-click on the downloaded file to run the Python 3 installer.
		<p>If you are using Windows download the suitable installer from the
			<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python website </a>. Double-click on the installer and
			on the first screen, check the “Add Python 3.x to PATH” option and install. This will let you
			use python in your terminal. Then click the “Disable path length limit” 
			option to will allow Python to use long path names. If after the installation you type python in the
		 terminal and still get an error then you will have to configure this manually. There is a good answer at 
			<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path">Superuser</a>
				 (be careful noto copy-paste mindlessly what you find on the Internet) and 
			<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/using/windows.html#finding-the-python-executable">docs</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>PyCharm and other editors</h4>
		<p>There is a number of good editors that you can use if you don't want to use PyCharm:
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
			</ul>
		You can download the free Community version from the 
		<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">JetBrains website</a>. It is fine if you want to use
		any other IDE but this is the one that we'll be mainly using for demonstrationg</p>
