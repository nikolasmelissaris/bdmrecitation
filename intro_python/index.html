		<strong><h2>October 11 - Intro to Python</h2></strong>
		
		<h4>Starting</h4>
		<p>There is a number of ways that we can do this. The simplest one is having the python intepreter 
			coupled with a text editor. This can be a bit tricky for people using the Windows 
			operating system so we will use a 
			neat IDE called PyCharm. At the end you can find some excellent resources to get you started.
		
		<h4>Downloading and installing Python 3 on your computer</h4>
		<p>If you are using a <strong>Mac</strong> simply head over to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python website </a> and
			download the most recent package. Then double-click on the downloaded file to run the Python 3 installer.
		<p>If you are using <strong>Windows</strong>, download the suitable installer from the
			<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> Python website </a>. Double-click on the installer and
			on the first screen, check the <code>Add Python 3.x to PATH</code> option and install. This will let you
			use python in your terminal. Then click the <code>Disable path length limit</code> 
			option to will allow Python to use long path names. If after the installation you type
			<pre class="bash">$ python</pre>  in the
		 terminal and still get an error then you will have to configure this manually. There are good answers 
		<a href="https://wsvincent.com/install-python3-windows/">here</a> (using PowerShell), at 
			<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path">Superuser</a>
				 (be careful no to copy-paste mindlessly what you find on the Internet), and 
			<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/using/windows.html#finding-the-python-executable">docs</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>Checking if things work</h4>
		<p>Mac users should be able to access interactive mode by just typing 
		<pre class="bash">$ python3</pre>
		and you should see something like:
		<pre class="bash">$ python3
Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24)
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>></pre> </p>
		
		<p>Alternatively you can check which version of python you have installed by typing:
			<pre class="bash">$ python3 -V</pre>
		which should return something like the following:
		<pre class="bash">$ python3 -V
Python 3.7.0</pre> </p>
		
		<p>On <strong>Windows</strong> you can type:
		<pre class="bash">C:\> python -V</pre>
		which should give you the version of <code>python</code> that you are using.
		If you see something like:
		<pre class="bash">'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</pre>
		Then you need to follow the instructions in the above section to set up your environment properly.</p>

		
		
		<h4>PyCharm and other editors</h4>
		<p>There is a number of good editors that you can use if you don't want to use PyCharm:
			<ul>
			<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></li>
			</ul>
		As far as PyCharm goes, you can download the free Community version from the 
		<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">JetBrains website</a>. It is fine if you want to use
		any other IDE but this is the one that we'll be mainly using for demonstrating stuff.</p>
		
		<p>You can find help installing PyCharm <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/install-and-set-up-pycharm.html">
			here</a>.
		<p>You may use Jupyter if you are comfortable with it but it will probably be a bit of a hassle
			later on. I will try and find some good resources for using Jupyter with SQL and I will post them
			here.</p>
		
			
		<h4>Resources for learning</h4>
		<p>There are hundreds of books/videos/websites that you can find if you search for "Python for Beginners".
		Below you can find some of my favorites:
		<ul class="b">
			<li><a href="https://python.swaroopch.com/">A byte of Python</a> is an introductory text for people with 
				no previous programming experience. You should read up to and including control flow.</li>
			<li><a href="http://hetland.org/writing/instant-hacking.html">Instant Hacking</a> A minimal crash course 
				that's an excellent starting point. He uses Python 2 though so be careful of the little differences.</li>
			<li><a href="https://checkio.org/">CheckIO</a> is a gamified website containing programming tasks.</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php">Python-Course.eu</a> 
				website has an extensive tutorial for complete beginners.
			<li>The University of Michigan has a nice class at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">
				Coursera</a>. You can enroll to the course and choose to audit for free.
		</ul></p>
			
		<p><strong>Important:</strong> Be sure that you have configured python properly and that you are able to run
			just the simplest scripts before the next tutorial. We can't afford to lose time trying to set up
			machines again.</p>
